Hi Samuel,

Attached the home assignment :

Implement a time clock service.
The service should have 2 main API features:
1. Allow employee report start & end working time.
2. Allow to receive monthly reports per employee of working hours per day and total per month.

Implement the service in whatever language and framework you feel comfortable with.
No need to implement login / session management. Use the employee name as part of the API.
Focus on code quality and build it in a way that you would implement those features for production.

If you have any questions, please let me know

Thanks,
